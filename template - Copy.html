          I celebrate you as you have attained 60years of Gods grace.
           You are a jewel of inestimable value and I love you more than words can wield this matter.

        <p>
          There are many Christians, but few as dedicated to God and the Catholic Church as you. You are an INSPIRATION!
          I admire how you are constantly trying to be a better version of yourself daily and constantly eager to profer solutions to problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          In your life, many including myself have seen that those that seek the face of the Lord are never found wanting.
           Even when the devil tried robbing you off your joy, you remained steadfast and sure that the Lord shall perfect all that concerns you. By His grace,
           you continually rise above every situation and deservingly so, because my Aunty you have served God dilligently.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are generousity personified so much that even when there is little, you ensure to reach out to the poor and lowly so they share with you. Arent you special?
         </p>
         <p>
           As a mother, you have toiled and toiled singlehandedly to give your children the absolute best by all standards and this is the standard for us young wives and mothers as it is obvious through you, that we have no excuse.
           I wish you a happy birthday and all the promises for God's faithful set out in Isaiah 65:17-24
